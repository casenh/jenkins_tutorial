This module (compute_highest_affinity.py) computes website affinities for a
list of search histories for different users and returns the pair of sites with
the highest affinity. It does so by first creating a list of websites visited
by each user and then totalling all possible pairs of sites across all users.
The highest_affinity function should be called with the input data already
processed.
